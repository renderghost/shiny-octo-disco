# Mystery: How can a cropped image weigh more [KB] than the larger [px] original?

> I have a portrait photo: 1920x1280 (2.4MP) and weighs 101 KB.
> I copy and crop it to 1278x1276 (1.6MP) but this smaller file weighs 319 KB ???
> 33% fewer pixels BUT 3x bigger file ðŸ“ˆ ???!!!
> How can this be? #WTF
